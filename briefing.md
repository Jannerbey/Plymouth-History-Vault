Welcome — and thank you for being here.

You are one of a small number of people invited to join the Plymouth History — Discovery Circle, a closed group helping shape something new, exciting, and quietly important for Plymouth’s historical future.

This is not an open programme.
It’s a hand-picked circle chosen because you’re curious, thoughtful, and someone who genuinely cares about Plymouth’s heritage.

Nothing complicated. Nothing technical.
Just simple participation that genuinely helps build something meaningful.

🌟 What You’re Joining

You’re stepping into the very first phase of a new Plymouth history experience — something entirely new that we’ve not announced publicly.

You’ll be among the first people in the world to see it, use it, influence it, and shape how it grows.

Your role is simple:

Use the app on your phone whenever you feel like it

Have a little explore — casually, naturally

Notice what feels good, what works, and what doesn’t

Drop quick, honest feedback whenever something stands out

That’s it.
No strict tasks. No pressure. No deadlines.

Just explore.

🧭 What We Ask of You

Being part of the Discovery Circle means:

1. Install the app

You’ll receive access to a private closed-test version.

2. Use it naturally

Open it now and again. Browse. Tap things.
See how it feels.

3. Give feedback (always)

Just a few lines whenever something useful pops into your head:

Something confusing

Something slow

Something that feels great

Something you wish existed

Something that looks wrong

Anything unexpected

Your feedback is gold dust.
Every message you send genuinely pushes the project forward.

4. Keep everything private

You’ll see things the public cannot.
Please don’t share screenshots, details, or anything about the project outside this group.

📝 How to Send Feedback

👉 Google Feedback Form

You can fill it in as often as you like — every little note helps.

🤝 Why You Matter

Plymouth’s history deserves a modern home.
Something living, growing, and accessible to everyone.
Not a closed archive. Not a forgotten cupboard.
A living, breathing vault of Plymouth’s past.

You’re helping build that.

You’re shaping something that will eventually be used by thousands of people across the city — and by people who love Plymouth from afar.

This is important work.
And it’s fun work.

🎉 Welcome to the Discovery Circle

You’re not a tester.
You’re a pioneer — the first wave.

Thank you for stepping in.
Let’s discover what Plymouth’s past can become next.
